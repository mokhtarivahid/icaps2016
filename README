Supplemental materials for the ICAPS 2016

This repository contains some examples and instances for the RACE project 
(http://project-race.eu/) represented in the proposed Experience-Based Planning Domains (EBPDs):

1) an application domain for the RACE project (race_domain.pddl)
2) some robot activity experiences (race_activity_experiences.pddl)
3) some learned activity schemata from experiences (race_activity_schemata.pddl)
4) task problems used to evaluate the performance of the approach over the 
   learned activity schemata and the plan solutions generated for these problems 
   (problems directory)
5) some examples of the plan solutions generated for a serve coffee scenario 
   to show the differences between the generated plan solutions and original 
   experience (i.e., in terms of the different plan lengths, different sequence 
   of actions, and different objects)


Following links also show the performance of this system in a real robot PR2 
in serve a coffee task:

1) A video to show how to instruct and teach a task to the robot and how to 
   conceptualize this task:     https://youtu.be/5Z6PJX6Ucfg

2) A video to show the performance of the system over the learned activity schema:
